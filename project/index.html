            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Heart Warriors Philippines aims to spread congenital acquired heart disease awareness and is dedicated in providing
            medical information, both to parents and patients. It also seeks donors and benefactors who will give financial and
            moral support to families living with this heart disease.</p>
            
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Heart Warriors Philippines was founded on May 23, 2011 by Gen Cabrera, originally under the name Congenital Heart
            Disease Philippines. In December 2016, the group was renamed to better reflect its mission of supporting all patients
            affected by serious heart conditions.</p>
            <p>Created from a parent’s promise to share knowledge and extend help, Heart Warriors Philippines emerged at a time when
            resources and support for congenital heart disease were scarce in the country. Gen Cabrera dedicated herself to building
            a community where families could access information, share experiences, and find guidance in navigating medical and
            financial challenges.</p>
            <p>Over the years, the organization has partnered with hospitals, NGOs, and programs such as the Rotary Club of Makati
            West’s Gift of Life, while also receiving support from advisers like Dr. Willie Ong. Today, Heart Warriors Philippines
            continues to grow as a nationwide network, committed to advocacy, medical missions, and providing hope to families
            facing the realities of heart disease.</p>
