            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Heart Warriors Philippines aims to spread congenital acquired heart disease awareness and is dedicated in providing
            medical information, both to parents and patients. It also seeks donors and benefactors who will give financial and
            moral support to families living with this heart disease.</p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Heart Warriors Philippines group was created on May 23, 2011 it was formerly known as Congenital Heart Disease
            Philippines but changed to Heart Warriors Philippines on December 28, 2016 to accommodate all types of patients who
            suffered from the dreaded Heart Diseases. Celebrity Doctor Willie Ong helps to promote the group that time and become
            one of our adviser.<br>
            
            Heart Warriors Philippines was created because of a promised to help parents suffered from the same crisis. To pay
            forward the support been given during difficult times. The information and resources about CHD that time were merely
            unavailable to the public. There are no existing Philippine support group at that time. No one shares and no one
            disclose information on how to avail assistance from the government and non-government office. I, Gen Cabrera resigned to my job so that
            I can focus on my son health condition. To assure that he will be taken cared. That is the turning point of our life so I
            decide to share all my experiences and knowledge earned so that no parents will suffer the same predicament. I started
            to gather resources and asked members to share their experiences which I know will be very helpful in the future.<br>
            
            I started to work with Rotary Club of Makati West with their program Gift of life wherein most of members got
            entertained with arms wide open. These days we continue to search for more resources more medical missions more people
            we can work with to avail assistance.</p>
