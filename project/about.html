            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Heart Warriors Philippines was founded on May 23, 2011 by Gen Cabrera, originally under the name Congenital Heart Disease Philippines. In December 2016 the group was renamed to better reflect its mission of supporting all patients affected by serious heart conditions. Created from a parent's promise to share knowledge and extend help, Heart Warriors Philippines emerged at a time when resources and support for congenital heart disease were scarce in the country.</p>
            <p>Over the years the organization has partnered with hospitals, NGOs, and programs such as the Rotary Club of Makati West's Gift of Life, while also receiving support from advisers like Dr. Willie Ong.</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>Our vision is a Philippines where families affected by congenital heart disease have access to information, medical care, and a supportive community. We strive to raise awareness, improve outcomes, and connect patients and caregivers with the resources they need.</p>
            <p>We deliver this by running outreach, partnering with hospitals and advocacy groups, and educating communities across the country.</p>
