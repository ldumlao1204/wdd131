            <h1>About Heart Warrior Philippines</h1>
            <p><p>Heart Warriors Philippines was founded on May 23, 2011 by Gen Cabrera, originally under the name Congenital Heart
                Disease Philippines. In December 2016, the group was renamed to better reflect its mission of supporting all
                patients
                affected by serious heart conditions.</p>
            <p>Created from a parent’s promise to share knowledge and extend help, Heart Warriors Philippines emerged at a time when
                resources and support for congenital heart disease were scarce in the country. Gen Cabrera dedicated herself to
                building
                a community where families could access information, share experiences, and find guidance in navigating medical and
                financial challenges.</p>
            <p>Over the years, the organization has partnered with hospitals, NGOs, and programs such as the Rotary Club of Makati
                West’s Gift of Life, while also receiving support from advisers like Dr. Willie Ong. Today, Heart Warriors
                Philippines
                continues to grow as a nationwide network, committed to advocacy, medical missions, and providing hope to families
                facing the realities of heart disease.</p>.</p>
